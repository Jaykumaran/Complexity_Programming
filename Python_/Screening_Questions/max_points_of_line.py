"""
1.Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of points on the same line, initially set to 1.
2.Iterate through each point (P1) in the given list of points.
3. For each point (P1), initialize a hash map to store the count of points with the same slope.
4. For each subsequent point (P2) in the list of points, excluding P1, calculate the slope between P1 and P2.
5. Store the slope in the hash map, incrementing the count for that slope.
6. Keep track of the maximum count of points with the same slope.
7.Handle coincident points separately by counting them and updating the maximum count accordingly.
8. Repeat steps 3â€“7 for all points in the list.
10. After iterating through all the points, the maximum count of points with the same slope is the answer to the problem.
