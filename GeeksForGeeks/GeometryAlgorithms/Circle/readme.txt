1. Area of square inscribed inside a circle

dia of square =  sqrt(2) * a
where, a is the radius of circle
R = d/2 = sqrt(2) * a / 2


2. Min radius for k points

- Find the distance sqaure between the point and the center, then sort them 
- Access the k-1th term as list are 0 indexed which is the smallest radius
